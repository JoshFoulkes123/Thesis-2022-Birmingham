This the repository comprising of my Thesis work done at the Univerisyt of Birmingham,UK in 2022.

To run open up Webots/worlds/test_arena_world.wbt in webots. This will open up the world with STEVE spider robot in the center.

The main files for the running of the robot are the Webots/controllers file.

steve_controller_V2 controls the basic movement with no optimisation.
steve_controller_ea is the optimisation file which when run will run a genetic rpogram that will run the simulation multiple times with the goal of optimising the walk for speed whilst preserving a suitbale level of movement accuracy.

For more detail please read the Thesis.pdf file for methodology and results.
